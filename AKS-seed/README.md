# Autonomous Knowledge System (AKS) -  ran out of memory tbc

**Co-Authors:** Craig Huckerby (Original Author), Gemini (developed by Google)

## Introduction

The Autonomous Knowledge System (AKS) is an ambitious project focused on developing a self-modifying, self-enhancing, and autonomously operating AI codebase. This repository represents a foundational, integrated "AGI Seed"â€”a functional framework designed with core architectural elements considered essential for a theoretical path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It emphasizes recursive self-improvement, continuous knowledge acquisition, and multi-agent orchestration.

## Current Status: A Functional Architectural Framework

This consolidated codebase provides a fully executable Python environment, demonstrating the robust scaffolding of the AKS. All core components are instantiated and interact within an autonomous cycle.

**Key Functional Aspects:**
* **Comprehensive Dependency Management:** Installs all necessary Python packages and `git-lfs` for a ready-to-run environment.
* **Robust Configuration:** Centralized `Config` class manages all system parameters, repository details, and API keys with validation.
* **Advanced Logging:** A `LogManager` provides detailed, color-coded console output and persistent file logging, crucial for monitoring autonomous operations.
* **Multi-AI Provider Support:** The `AIProviderManager` enables dynamic selection and fallback between different AI models (e.g., Google Gemini, Hugging Face GPT-2), ensuring operational resilience.
* **File System Management:** The `FileHandler` provides essential file and directory operations within the repository's workspace.
* **API Interaction Hub:** The `APIHandler` centralizes external API calls, incorporating rate limiting, retries, authentication, and caching for reliable data exchange.
* **Orchestrated Autonomy:** The `AutonomousAgent` manages the core operational loop, coordinating various components through a `TaskScheduler` for concurrent execution.
* **Git Integration:** The `GitManager` facilitates autonomous version control, committing and pushing changes to the remote repository, enabling self-modification and rollback capabilities.
* **Gradio UI:** An optional web-based interface for interactive control and monitoring.

**"STUB" Implementations:**
While the architectural framework is robust and executable, many of the advanced intelligent functionalities (e.g., deep code analysis, sophisticated knowledge inference, advanced security checks) are currently represented by **stubbed (placeholder) methods**. These methods log their intended actions and return generic success indicators but do not yet perform their full, intelligent operations. This design allows for the testing and refinement of the system's control flow and integration before the full intelligence of each module is implemented.

## How to Run: The Colab Enhancer

This repository is designed to be run via a Google Colab notebook, providing a consistent execution environment.

1. **Open Google Colab:** Navigate to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. **Create a New Notebook:** Select "File" -> "New notebook".
3. **Copy and Paste:** Copy the entire code content from this file into the first cell of your Colab notebook.
4. **Input Credentials:** When prompted, enter your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (classic token recommended) and optionally your Gemini API Key. These are required for Git operations and AI model access.
5. **Run the Cell:** Execute the cell by clicking the "Play" button or pressing `Shift + Enter`.
6. **Observe:** The system will install dependencies, clone the repository, set up its environment, and begin its autonomous cycles, logging output directly to the Colab console and to files within the cloned repository. If Gradio installs successfully, a UI will launch.

## Key Architectural Components (AGI Seed Perspective)

The AKS is structured around several critical components that lay the groundwork for AGI:

* **Self-Enhancement & Auto-Commit:** The `CodebaseEnhancer` combined with `GitManager`'s commit capabilities allows the system to theoretically modify its own source code, test those changes, and integrate them. This **recursive self-improvement** is a hypothesized pathway to an intelligence explosion in AGI.
* **Knowledge Acquisition & Integration:**
* `InformationSourcing`: Gathers data from diverse external sources (web, APIs).
* `KnowledgeProcessor`: Processes and integrates raw information into a coherent knowledge base.
* `VectorDB`: Provides semantic understanding and retrieval from the knowledge base, enabling contextual reasoning for AI models.
* **Modular & Orchestrated Architecture:**
* `AgentOrchestrator`: Manages the lifecycle and task distribution for multiple specialized agents, enabling complex, distributed intelligent operations.
* `TaskScheduler`: Facilitates concurrent execution of tasks, optimizing resource utilization.
* **Resilience & Adaptability:**
* `ResilienceManager`: Ensures system stability through snapshots and recovery mechanisms.
* `APIHandler`: Provides robust interaction with external services, handling transient failures.
* `LogManager` & `AuditManager`: Offer detailed observability and post-mortem analysis capabilities.
* **Multi-AI Provider Support:** Allows the system to leverage a diverse range of AI models, adapting to different task requirements and ensuring redundancy.

## Roadmap to Actual AGI Seed Classification

To move from this robust framework to being classified as an "actual AGI Seed" (i.e., a system with concrete, observable capabilities directly contributing to the path to AGI), the following critical developments are required:

1. **Deepened Component Intelligence (Replacing Stubs):**
* **`CodebaseEnhancer`:** Implement genuine, AI-driven code analysis, refactoring, and generation capabilities that **autonomously modify system components** based on performance metrics, security audits, or new functional requirements. These modifications must demonstrably improve the system.
* **`KnowledgeProcessor`:** Develop sophisticated algorithms for **semantic parsing, knowledge graph construction, and autonomous inference**, enabling the system to derive new facts and relationships from acquired data, not just store it.
* **`InformationSourcing`:** Implement advanced, AI-guided strategies for **adaptive data acquisition**, autonomously identifying and utilizing new data sources and APIs based on current knowledge gaps or task requirements.
* **`VectorDB` (Full Implementation):** Integrate a full-fledged vector embedding, indexing, and retrieval system (e.g., using `sentence-transformers` for embeddings and a local vector store) that enables **true contextual understanding** for all AI generation tasks.
* **`TestingFramework`:** Implement AI-driven **test generation (unit, integration, regression)** and autonomous execution to verify self-modifications and ensure system integrity.
* **`SecurityManager`:** Develop **proactive, AI-driven vulnerability detection**, threat modeling, and self-patching mechanisms.
* **`AgentOrchestrator` (Full Interaction Protocol):** Implement the full communication and task-reporting protocols for individual agents to **autonomously request tasks, execute them, and report detailed outcomes** back to the orchestrator. This involves clear API definitions for agent-orchestrator interaction.

2. **Emergent Learning & Reasoning Capabilities:**
* **Generalized Problem Solving (Limited):** The system should demonstrate the ability to **adapt to novel tasks within its domain** (e.g., a new programming language, a new data format for knowledge) without explicit reprogramming, showcasing transfer learning.
* **Basic Meta-Learning:** Beyond self-modification, the system should show evidence of **learning *how to learn* more efficiently**, for instance, by improving its own prompt engineering strategies or optimizing its AI model usage based on past performance.
* **Causal Inference (Elementary):** Begin to implement mechanisms for **understanding basic cause-and-effect relationships** within its operational domain, rather than just correlation.
* **Adaptive Planning:** The system should autonomously **decompose abstract goals** (e.g., "improve system efficiency") into concrete, executable sub-tasks, adapting its plan based on real-time feedback.

3. **Measurable Performance & Evaluation:**
* Establish **clear, objective metrics** to quantify the "intelligence" and "effectiveness" of its autonomous enhancements, knowledge acquisition, and task completion. This moves beyond simple operational logs to actual performance benchmarks.

The current AKS code provides the essential **nervous system and circulatory system** for an AGI Seed. The "organs of intelligence" are being built, and the roadmap focuses on imbuing these organs with their full, autonomous, and self-improving functions.
