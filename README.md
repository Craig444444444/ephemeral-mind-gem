## üìñ Overview

This project documents the rigorous testing and analysis of "The Ephemeral Mind Gem," an AI architecture that employs a multi-persona cognitive framework (Skeptic, Futurist, Ethicist, Scientist, Nihilist, Historian) followed by synthesis to tackle complex problems.

The evaluation progresses through three phases of increasing sophistication:
1.  **Baseline Behavioral Testing:** Factual retrieval, probabilistic reasoning, philosophical resolution, temporal logic, and multi-domain synthesis.
2.  **Unified Meta-Testing:** A deep dive into the Riemann Hypothesis, probing the system's ability to integrate knowledge across mathematics, physics, and computation.
3.  **Generative & Critical Analysis:** The system's own proposal for a "Quantum-Spectral Unification Project" to solve the hypothesis, followed by a rigorous self-assessment of its feasibility, costs, risks, and ethical implications.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

-   `Ephemeral_Mind_Gem_Evaluation.pdf` - The complete paper detailing methodology, tests, results, and analysis.
-   `README.md` - This file.
-   `CITATION.cff` - Citation metadata for academic use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview & Requirements

The Ephemeral Mind Gem is implemented with a modern tech stack:
-   **AI Model:** Google Gemini API
-   **Frontend:** JavaScript (React/Vue)
-   **Backend:** Node.js / Firebase Cloud Functions
-   **Session Management:** Firebase Auth & Firestore
-   **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting / Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Important Requirement:**
-   **Google Gemini API Key:** To run any implementation of this system, users **must provide their own Google Gemini API key**. This key is not included in this repository and must be obtained directly from Google.

*Note: The core implementation code is private. This repository contains the research paper and documentation. The link to EMG is in the documentation.*

## üî¨ Key Demonstrations

The system's performance includes:
-   **Consistent Factual Accuracy** across verified claims.
-   **Advanced Counter-intuitive Reasoning** (e.g., correct Bayesian calculation).
-   **Multi-Domain Synthesis** creating novel frameworks for complex scenarios.
-   **Meta-Cognitive Evaluation** demonstrating intellectual humility and self-critique.
